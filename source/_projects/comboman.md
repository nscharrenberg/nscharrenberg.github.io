Comboman is a multiplayer platform fighting game. Battle up to 4 other people from around the world. Use the weapons and power ups you find to eliminate your opponents and win the game.

Comboman is a java based game running on a server using RMI (Java Remote Method Invocation). Originally based on Bomberman and later-on changed to be more similarly to smash broâ€™s.
