Blockchain & Open Badges is a research project. It’s meant to gather suggestions and advice onto the possiblity of implemented Blockchain with the open badges standard.

We spend the majority of the time doing research onto the following subjects:
- What is blockchain?
- What are open badges, it’s standard and platform (Badgr)?
- Would open badges be suitable combined with Blockchain?
- What would be the most suitable framework for this project?

We took a lot of research onto finding the most suitable blockchain framework, eventually Hyperledger Fabric coming out as best fit.
