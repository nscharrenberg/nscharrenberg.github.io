Hojo / Playmates is a tinder-like sports app where you can find people to play sports with.

Hojo / Playmates is a international project developed together with a students from Oulu, Finland.

Discord was being used for communication, communication was done atleast once a week to keep each other updated and to show progress and gather todo’s from each other

The dutch students worked on the back-end (logic and api’s) while the Finnish students worked on building a front-end website using Angular.

The dutch students also worked on a mobile design and eventually made their own front-end website using VueJS.
