During my study at Fontys University of Applied Sciences I've been taught the ins-and-outs of Software Engineering through the use op "Open Learning" also called "Open Innovation".
Being encouraged to not only learn best practices, but also giving the opportunity for me to learn technologies I'm interested in and applying this knowledge in practice together with company stakeholders.
