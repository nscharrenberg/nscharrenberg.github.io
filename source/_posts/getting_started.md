On the 15th of February 2021, the MSV Incognito hackers IT Team gave a workshop for creating your own personal static website using Jekyll.
During this workshop I took lead in explaining the basics on setting-up your website using a template and deploying it to github pages, but also a more in-depth explanation to working with templates and styling.

We made the repository and "Basic" workshop recording available on github: [workshop repository & recording](https://github.com/msvincognito/static-site-workshop)
